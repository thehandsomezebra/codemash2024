[[TRANSCRIPT Writing secure APIs - A look at the OWASP 2023 API Top 10 List]]



https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/


**Security awareness around APIs and the top 10 API vulnerabilities are discussed to provide guidance for developers in securing APIs.**

- Common API vulnerabilities include:

> - Insecure authentication and authorization
> - Lack of proper input validation
> - Excessive data exposure
> - Lack of rate limiting
> - Lack of proper encryption
> - Poor logging and monitoring
> - Lack of API documentation and testing

- To improve API security, developers should:

> - Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms
> - Validate input data to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting
> - Limit data exposure by only returning necessary data
> - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
> - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
> - Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents
> - Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation and testing to help developers use the API securely
