[[TRANSCRIPT Out of Control- How to rescue a struggling software project]]


![[Rescuing Project Codemash 2024.pptx]]




**To rescue a failing project, follow these 15 principles:**

- **Principle 1: Automate all checks:**
	- Automate formatting, linting, tests, and error handling to improve code quality and consistency.

- **Principle 2: Use checklists for non-automatable aspects:**
	- Create checklists for code reviews, documentation, accessibility, and security to ensure quality.

- **Principle 3: Document decisions and code:**
	- Document project decisions, code architecture, and the "why" behind code comments to improve collaboration and understanding.

- **Principle 4: Colocate related code:**
	- Organize code logically and group related code together to improve maintainability and readability.

- **Principle 5: Mark and centralize legacy code:**
	- Deprecate and centralize legacy code to prevent its use and maintain a consistent codebase.

- **Principle 6: Assign one person responsible for quality:**
	- Make one person responsible for code quality to ensure standards are met and technical debt is managed.

- **Principle 7: Run code in reviews:**
	- Pair program and run code during reviews to identify issues and improve collaboration.

- **Principle 8: Validate at runtime:**
	- Use runtime validation with tools like Zod to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.

- **Principle 9: Minimize environments:**
	- Reduce environment proliferation and only maintain necessary environments.

- **Principle 10: Align repos with the project goal:**
	- Group related repos together and eliminate silos to improve collaboration and streamline development.

- **Principle 11: Streamline DX and tests with mocks:**
	- Consider using mock service workers and custom development tools to improve developer experience and testing efficiency.

- **Principle 12: Foster true collaboration:**
	- Break down team silos, encourage daily standups, and unify teams to improve collaboration and communication.

- **Principle 13: Monitor errors:**
	- Implement error tracking tools to identify, reproduce, and resolve errors quickly.

- **Principle 14: Create and utilize a design system:**
	- Establish a design system to ensure consistent user experience, reusable components, and improved development efficiency.

- **Principle 15: Document your reuse strategy:**
	- Document how you reuse code, including unit tests, discoverability, shared locations, and Storybook documentation.
