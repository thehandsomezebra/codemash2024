Feel free, as I start to pop. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. What can I ask is? You raise your hand, not listen for you like my wife, indoors, me or more. So just so I can get me. I'll finish the current train of thought. But alas, answer any questions that I, I can. If I can, I'll just, you know, if your name and email and get back to you. One of the things I've always wanted to do as a presenter, I can only put up the PowerPoint with the title of the show prior to. I've always wanted to put a different title on it, just to see if people actually come to the room and still sit down and say it, but I'm always afraid that if I do that, people are going to say, wait that's not the topic. It's supposed to be able to start cleaning and going elsewhere. So I've never done that. You're not going to be some problem nurse, even in the front, grown. Hey, Deborah, just walked in. Can you close the door behind you please? Thank you. Because I'm always very noisy. So we're here to talk about Dev containers, which are commonly cope has referred to as remote containers, which sometimes refer to developer indicators. When it first started, it was called remote containers. And actually, the visual Studio plug-in for this video who plug-in now, we still actually reverse one, uh, Nave up there, my contact info, if you want to take pictures or send email address that you have any questions, All the examples that I am going to show you will be available on my site. The last one on the end about dgd. If there are any links in the slides and they all start the jjg.e slash something disability skills. This deck as well as a sample and any references that I made in the code are all going to be on that site. Underneath the Uh, presentations. And I'll pull this light up at the end. Let's go to our agenda. We're going to talk about getting started. What you need to. Get started with this. We're going to kind of walk through the semantics of what a developer container is. And then we're going to spend some time building customizing.

Speaker 2   02:51
And

Speaker 1   02:51
Then showing you how you can use containers and Across the end. We are going to work with a depth container that has multiple containers. We may be able to know they.net app with the SQL Server. All sitting inside this navigator and then as time permits depends on how many questions we're actually going to open up a debt container on GitHub and not use, you know, Docker on my desktop or So let's get started again. For those of you joined late, if you have any questions, feel free to raise your hand and I'll get to you at the next logic. So I've definitely games. Sure many have heard this many times first, on my machine, whatever has a software engineer for very plus pages or 30 plus years. I said, this more than one time so This is kind of the reason why we want to do that to kind of avoid it working on my machine or you know, I just joined the new company and I asked the lead engineer. How do I get started with using the product? It's like, okay, well, download these 17 different things go to this conference page. Follow these 35 different steps, Go to the church, put a quarter in a mask, pray that it's going to work. Then find Javier who has the SQL scripts, then find blah, blah blah. Who has this and it's a, it's a hot box. So, Dev containers tries to solve that by putting everything you need. Inside of that deck, and inside of that container. Let's say there's some of the requirements and these requirements have been changed over time. But basically you need Docker desktop, Either on back or Windows. And if you are a Rancher person, you can use a branch or two. But all the doctors say doctor that's not if you're using Linux, God bless you, but You would need Dr. CD for the any version of 2.0 higher, if you're using Docker desktop on Windows, it's strongly recommended to use the WSL Windows subsystem for Linux. You then need Visual Studio code as of right now. The reason why I say, as of right now is Jeffrey Ryder, has a add-on for it. It's actually built into the IEE, but it's in beta space. St. Also has a release in preview for using, but right now I'm going to use it through Visual Studio code, because that's the one that we have fully works the goal of each other. You then need the death containers extension. Now depending on the documentation you see you might see something that says you have containers. I might say remote container. Some might say, developer computers. Studio One, I'll share on the screen which is what it is. Uh and it'll be linked to. I can get the slide deck is the one. You actually need to get it to work. So let's talk about building some containers before you do that, let's kind of look at what makes the containers. So these are basically You have your debt container. So, You have the depth container itself, which is this blue set of controls for these two columns. And you have the production contam, So, we focus on right now is The OS runtime and share of virus. That's the the meat of the container. So that has everything. Like you're going to be running on Windows or Linux, you're going to be using. Let's just say, dot pets and shows the examples I'm going to be using for the beginning and whatever shared line means. The death container. I don't need, I don't need the compiler. I don't need the SDK build tools, Etc. When I push the product, I don't want to ship the.net SDK that has MS build, or if I'm using MPM, I don't want to. I don't want to install them at the build, so that's where the dev dictators. Are it starts to shift, left, all the stuff that's in there. But for the actual development, these are the things we need. We care about about your the operating system, the personalization productivity tools Visual Studio writer Etc. And that's, and that's kind of where the devotators spin. So what are they made of? We're basically three coupons, you have this template very enjoyment. The template is the operating system. And what libraries, you say, I have a template, I'm going to build a C sharp F. And it's gonna get you a c-sharp SDK with the runtime, the build tool on a operating system. It's working with Docker right now would be Linux and they'll download a Linux image. Same thing if you were to go and do a Docker full, MCR dot, whatever, And there's features you grow on top of and these features are the things you want to kind of build, think of it as the workloads for visual Studios and ASP development on the Azure development. So we add All those tools. So we're going to add in a couple of the first two or three demos. And then the last piece that damn, that's a really kind of puts everything together and that's the personalization. I'm going to show you my visual Studio code. And it's not to update the bar. It has like 80 some odd plug-ins because I need lots of different things. And as a speaker, I'm always playing around. But if I'm going to building an app for a client, let's say they only have Visual Studio C4. Anyone would want those extensions? I don't like the cost would be 80 or 80 some other extensions. Yeah, we also might like to use just visual Studio code, something would prefer regular visuals to get some people disturb jackets, writer and that's whether one of the power Deputers come in, is that you have that ability to customize it Let's take a look at the templates. Can't believe we're available in many and this is the link, you'll see more and I'm going to show you the site just basically app on debit.com Ruby so on and so forth. There are hundreds of them and a lot of them are open source too. There are some that are maintained by the deaf dinner University which is yourself a couple of other community. But as we'll see under on two slides. A Some of the features in add-ons, there's JW. A lot of those things you're used to. I know when I first got this slot Bob a month ago, I spent the day just least building, almost all these things on here because it's what you need with Dev containers. You can actually just install that so I can go to this show. It's PC, pull down my Dev computer and have all that in there and not mess up. As you can see, that's one of the, the great buildings Let's take a look at some of those. I think that's the end of the PowerPoints for a while. Water turn on the other screen. Turn this off. A couple of flickers. So let's go, there's a lot of Windows up here. So this is the plug-in, you're going to use. So if you go to visual Studio, Visual Studio code Marketplace, settings or Marketplace admissionstudio.com? Search for deaf containers, you'll pull it. Or you can just take the notes later on when I show up the reference slide and do it. So let's take a look at some of the templates that are is a font, big enough in the package shows. Okay. You see when, as I start scrolling through the list there'll be a bunch of death containers that maintainers. So this is the quote unquote core product group, that works on it and you'll see there's C plus Maria, DB existing knocker, Docker, Docker chakra, outside adopter.com, lots of Docker in that one, it's always fun setting and then you get the C sharp, F, sharp C. Sharp. You notice, there's no BB in here and there's no Thank you. It's maybe I they just the team is focused on putting out C, sharp, look, I I think there's actually a BB1 forever right now. Nothing is. You see, it's not just Microsoft Technology. So if you're a PHP shop, they use Maria database. You can choose that one. And, you know, work with As you start scrolling down, you'll see that there are a couple that are submitted by the community. So, let's Sutter created one for node.js. A couple others. And these are all hyperlinks. So if I want to go 2 and see what they are, I can click on the C sharp one and actually see the details, we're not going to go into that because I'll show you what we actually build one. Features work the same way. Generally, you see, we have Anaconda AWS Azure, common utilities, and the list goes on this list. As you can see here, With the scroll bar goes on forever. So it's a good shot. If there's something you're using in the development world, it's going to be on These notes here are how you can add it using what Visual Studio code. You don't need to worry about that. Visual Studio code will take care of it. But if you're going for punishment, like to use notepad or development, you want to write your own, uh, cock container or cocktail container file, you can click, but we'll show you, okay, taking care of Enough of the talking and bad humor. Let's go. And look at one. So, this is a backup in case Visual Studio or the network here fails later on. It downloads Docker containers and sometimes, even though I did it last night, there's always a one update to a layer that causes the entire thing to be Uh, redownloaded I always have a backup. Is that one generally takes a while? So I'm going to do open folder. And Jesus. Folder. As you can see nothing there. Nothing up my sleeves. That's why we're shortly shirts. Uh and even to see the dock, I'll open up the news. We just opened up this roller nothing in there, okay? So we're going to start off with the command palette which is Ctrl shift p or if you're on a Mac device, it's control. Unless you change your I take Dev containers. I'm gonna get a couple of different options. Now this list grows every time I do this demo. As you can see, the most recently used the top three of the ones will probably ever need. But it's getting better and better like to clean up old wines as you'll see, as I show you my doctor Add this one here, which is the backup one. Just in case, the panda dies here, this is my personal work stuff. This is my lip box. So, I only have three containers here. We're going to go and create a new Let's start with the add depth, container file. The first thing you do with it is you have to select your template. As you see here, Uh again zoom in that would build. So I was assuming Computer itself. I get to choose to minimize that. I get to choose. What kind of container let's just do you see sharp because that's easiest and let the screen just brightly jump around. Once I do that. You can click ok. Now I start getting into the options. Now, these options are specific to These options are specific to that Temple. So, each template might have one or more options because some choosing C sharp as it the template says, okay, what versions C sharp do you want you want C, shared six, where given a bullseye image, which is the variation of YouTube or do I want seven working on bookworm or Dynamic. Normally, I would choose 90. For this. However, I am not going to choose it for this demo because there is a problem image. It's not necessarily a problem but this is some of the security changes that were made the dot. Net 8 doesn't work without a bunch of extra. It's got to say I have to do. Actually, let's just You'll see the errors just in case this way you don't have to Google it. You'll need a, you know, 100. 200 people that actually know how to fix that problem when it comes up now, we're choosing the features. So this sustains like, do I want the actual CLI? What I want it in there. Do I want? Uh, We're in CLI. So there's a bunch of applications. I'm going to just choose a couple that I use even though we're really not going to use this. Common utilities. Is. I love people. My, oh my gosh. Plug in. So I'm going to shoot status. And because we would typically want to Uh, I'm going to choose the GitHub CLI. And when I click, OK, I'm going to get any options or any defaults for those. Right now, there are really no defaults, I need to worry about, but if you're choosing like the s csh, he's going to want to know your theme and everything. I've just for sake of this, we're just going to keep them default. Once they do that proceed down here, I get adding the dirty tamer visual Studio just created it. Now, you're gonna get this dialog box, it says, hey if you want to reopen a container, I'm gonna choose to ignore that for now because I want to explain what the dev containers and I'll show you how you can pull. So, let's go and hide this. You see, you get two wings. Here's how you format the file basically it takes you to a website, it just shows you as well as here that takes you to the website with templates. And if you click on dot net, this is where you're gonna go. So here it says the name. So, you can call this anything you want. This Navy is really only used for your IDE. So, down here in the lower left hand corner, you see this little blue. Uh, greater than less than sine. That's going to show you the name of the interior, you're working in right now. I'm not working in any. So if I change this to Code mesh. So when I build this, it's going to do this. Remember when I said hey if we're going to do features visual Studio code, we'll take care of that. What you see here? It did that whole ghdr.io generous features, blah blah blah. Put all that there for me. So this is to say I'm going to call this kodesh Prime. I'm going to use this image which is looks like a regular docker read that you pulled out if you did not work full or two menus or something like that and it says we're going to pull down to dotnet One Dash. So everything here, the 8.0, boom bookworm. Is that option? I chose at the beginning. So if you look at the template on GitHub, we'll see that there is a placeholder for that, default and it put that in there. Basically says School now from mcrl microsoft.com Desmond, Tanners the 8.0 bookmark version. The rest. We're gonna ignore for now. We're gonna come back to that next now, So I'm gonna go draw window key and not Ctrl to And I'm going to rebuild and opening container. What's going to happen here is it's going to start to build this. And you'll see here, It's going to go through and it's going to start pulling down those images and create a Docker container for me. Can you see? Hopefully, I plug in directly into the internet here. Hopefully it's fast and it looks like it's going pretty fast, but it's now it's starting to go as if I did the Docker. Pull. And it's starting to pull down, all those images and get the software that's required for visual Studio code, to talk directly to Uh, the container. There's like no room under here. My water pump is right now. Extension, cords up again electrocuted. So you'll also see in the lower left hand corner of those blue angle, reverse angle rocket started changing. Because now it's opening remote it's building it You'll see, now I have this container. I think Containers started it says, oh we're connected to a dev container called code, Mash Prime dot net and then there's some port, forwarding at port, forwarding is for visual Studio to be able to talk to the container. Because remember, the doctor container is just a separate isolated sheet on your, on, your laptop or Hardware is kind of establishes that connection to it. It also installed some other tools in there. You see, it install c-sharp, that's basically because we said, where you see sharps is going to install that. I will show you how you can add your own custom tools. In the next iteration of this. Now we have a container that has nothing in it. If you go look at shocker, And hit refresh. Oh, there it is, right there. I see, I have the, I always love these names, but it's the same this defying Moser. So there's a whole team at git of zero. The ones that started with the, uh, project that just comes up with these names. There is during Halloween, they came up with something like angry witch or a lot scary attack. It's always some accent with the name and I did this demo. A couple of months ago and it came with Uh, rotary underscore of foam. I was going to know what the hell that is. But it's always fun and you can go and rename these like you would do with Dr. Doctor of Uh so there's nothing. Here we go. Back. And look at that folder. You see the folder has a depth container and you I have everything I need to start working on this so this is going to be a c-sharp app. So let's go. You create a C sharp app. So let's go here and I'm gonna open up the terminal. Now, this terminal automatically goes there. Now, this one I can close is this is the definition. So I'm just going to hit new and you'll see it's already in the workspace. I'm just going to minimize this because there's not a lot of screen. So it created a folder called workspaces container demo. So if you know anything about doctorate, there's audience and stuff. So this is basically get a path mapping to See, projects container demo. So I do a list here, you'll see. That one folder with that forward stable. So I'm going to do a DOT net. New and I have to earn my speaker credentials. This is my first talk in the year. So hello world. Hello, you console. The world. This is why a lot of speakers don't type. Probably a lot of speakers go into live. Developments little psy type people. Okay, so now I just created it And I go here and I see Hello World and then there's the hello world app. Out of that. It's saying hey, if you want to install the extension support, that's visual Studios. Say, I know it's there. I just use, yes. Install just to give me some of that stuff. Again, this is all just installing inside of that data. Let's go and do a couple of extra. Bright lines of the world. Okay. And then we'll do console. Okay. And assuming that is done, installing it. About this stuff I can hit play. And in the console here. You should say hello world. Hello code Mash. And a Now, none of you saw me create a breakpoint there so why did it break? Well because I've done this demo a thousand times visual Studio. I guess. Cash stuff like that. Had a breakpoint there. The previous ones but it basically gave you the next part of the demo. I still have full control in here of it. I can put breakpoints in here. I can see The output any problems or anything and I can just hit play. And go and we'll see, I eventually Does the hello world of codemash or hello? Sandusky and I can do it again. So, Cool. Nothing really awesome to see there. Let's go and take a look at maybe turning that into a And got that web application. So you know what? Most people knew it and start a new project and the old project you don't feel the best. So It is still still using C sharp. I'm still in the container so I can play around with this one. Let's go back here and test my typing skills. Some more and see if I can take this one correctly. There's a new web app, we'll do. Hello world. And it. Stat's done, you'll see. I get a template here. That's hello world. It has projects. It has the app settings that we would see the accent it's Json and our program file that says hello world. Every demo should have just a single So if I navigate into that. And what we'll see here in a minute is visual studio is going to come up with a crop? Okay, perfect time. That says, hey, your application is running on four. Five, two, seven, eight. Do you want to open it browse? I do that. I'm just going to open up. The web browser with that board and I'll see you right here. And it says, What if I don't want that annoying prompt? You could actually change. Deputy here. Often to say, I know the sap is going to On that port. So let's go back to For instance. Stop that. Over here in this. Really hard for me to step over your zoomed in so much. It's very fun. So you notice there's a section here that says four reports and said to ignore this one from any of us between We are going to use it. So the forward Port says is when you create the Docker container just like you would your regular traffic container expose these ports. So all you do is basically give it an array of ports you want to open up and then you can get core patch of views of 5000. Yeah whatever protocol you want to run it now just a note on this. Those attributes if you're using the visual Studio. Proper plastic, whatever the original version or jet brings right in. They don't support that yet in their future. So, if I look at my local host, Which is under here. I can see that I want to expose 5270 and 7189. Possible to remember. So, And it hears, the first one. And the second one was, And then save it. Once I save it, Visual Studio says, hey, you change your Doctor, container file, you want me to rebuild it? And I'm going to click rebuild, because it basically has to carry down that Docker image and recreate it, because we're now exposing those two cores. You'll also notice, once it's done that, this port is going to change. For this port, option will eventually change to show those two ports open. Which is listing now. So, this is the auto forwarded words, which are the ones by visual Studio when I ran it. The first time 5196 was worth. And now I'm saying, open up. 71 89 and 72 that. Or 71. Yeah. 52 78. That's there. So now I'm I'm done with that. So that's a good example, for amazing. Basically a speed.net one. So let's go through a little bit more. Complicated example. So, we are going to choose another one. We're going to open up a the container demo sequel. So the idea behind this one is hey I'm getting a new project. I'm gonna work with SQL Server and I'm going to work with C sharp. Well, I don't want to have to install a SQL Server, developer Studio or my machine. That's a piece and I don't have enough this space so I'm going to just use documents. Now there's nothing stopping you from just having a Docker in since a SQL Server like Here, that's disabled this one actually. This one here. The purpose of doing it this way, is that I can share this Dr. Container with someone else and say, here, you have exactly what's needed to start with this product. If you're doing solo development, it doesn't make as much sense, unless you like to keep your desktop clean. So, one of the other benefits of this is, I can have two different projects from two different versions of node and not have two different versions of code. On my desktop, multiple versions of the DOT and SDK filling No again, nothing up my sleeve. Let's go to the MS. Demo Ms. SQL nothing up there. So Ctrl shift p. Add def container file. Look for the word C, sharp and SQL. Click that. We're gonna go with bookworm. Again. I could put in whatever we're not going to really use anything sometimes, okay? Added to that configuration model. This Dev configuration file. Looks like it looks a lot different. It looks very different. Notice there's this MS. SQL folder. Now, there's a Docker file. The debt container cases to show you before. This was different for a couple reasons, one is because it's gonna build two containers. The previous one really built one and now it's just C sharp. Now you need a C sharp container and an MS. SQL container and that's where the docker compose. So let's take a look at this Json from the deputy interior. Json foxy, looks different. Of the name. So the name is the same. Always Sequel. But it's using this Docker computer. It's also setting up the workspaces to point to a folder. The reason why it's doing this is it wants a place to save the data locally, just in case you want to copy that database. But here's something different the customizations file for customization section. So this allows you to do is figure property specific to visuals to your code. So, almost on the alert, This is saying for visual Studio code. Apply these settings, So, it's saying create in your settings. And then use all. Many people use the database tools within visual Studio projects. So this is basically that we're going to pre-create the connection string to it. So Visual Studio will be able to connect directly to the database. Now, the proverbial speaker kids, don't try this at home. Don't have your password essay main password. But in this particular case, it doesn't matter as much as this is just my local as container of SQL server. That's only running on my machine and if I start passing this around to other people, it's going to be their local life direction. It's not like I'm connecting to our corporate SQL Server employee.
