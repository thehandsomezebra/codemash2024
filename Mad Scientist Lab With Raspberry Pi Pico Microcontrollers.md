##### **Presented by:** [Barry Tarlton](https://codemash.org/speaker-details?id=8df97796-8644-4bb5-82e3-103a3c34138c), [Brendan Barth](https://codemash.org/speaker-details?id=145c3c07-2cd4-44ee-9048-4f7ab3219efb)

Time: Wednesday, Jan. 10, 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Carefully plugging the wires into the bread board, doubt seeps in, “should the red wire go to ground or the white one?” LEDs all in place, Python code properly indented (spaces, not tabs), prayers go up for the magic smoke to not escape as the electronics are powered on. In an instant, worries subside as the microcontroller springs to life and the twinkling of little lights glowing in the precise rhythm as instructed by your code testifies that software and hardware are in perfect harmony.  
  
Amazing experiences like this and more can be yours in this session. You’ll get to create your own awesome game with sharks and lasers using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and a variety of other electrical components. Learn to merge electronics and software in beautiful harmony. The Pi Pico is an inexpensive microcontroller that can run MicroPython to control a plethora of electrical doodads. If you want to bring your code into the real world with crazy inventions, come to this session to get the foundational skills you need to release your inner mad scientist!
