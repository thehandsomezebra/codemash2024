[[TRANSCRIPT Alerts don't suck. YOUR alerts suck]]


Out of all the sessions, this is one that I would highly recommend everyone to watch the recording that was posted from another session and is hosted on youtube.

**Alerts should provide value to the recipient, or they are useless.** They should be actionable, relevant, timely, and clear.

- **Alerts should be actionable.** The recipient should be able to take some action in response to the alert.
- **Alerts should be relevant.** The recipient should care about the information in the alert.
- **Alerts should be timely.** The recipient should receive the alert in a timely manner so that they can take action before it's too late.
- **Alerts should be clear.** The recipient should be able to understand the alert and what action to take.

**Additional points:**

- **Alerts should be tested regularly.** Test that the right person receives the alert and that they can take the appropriate action.
- **Alerts should be prioritized.** The recipient should be able to tell which alerts are most important and need to be addressed first.
- **Alerts should be documented.** The recipient should have access to documentation that explains what each alert means and what action to take.
