It’s no secret that a new generation of powerful and highly-scaled language models is taking the world by storm. Large language models are becoming a powerful new primitive for building software.  
In this precompiler, we will deep dive into the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) & how software developers can leverage the untapped potential of LLMs. The hands-on exercises will give the audience a first-hand experience building applications on top of LLMs. Using Python, OpenAI, Langchain, and vector databases, developers will learn how to build intuitive conversational interfaces for their applications, making them more engaging and user-friendly.
