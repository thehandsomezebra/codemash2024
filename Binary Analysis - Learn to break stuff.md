#### Binary Analysis - Learn to break stuff

##### **Presented by:** [Jason Slagle](https://codemash.org/speaker-details?id=68accf5c-4f6c-406f-806a-38f0527793b5), [John Hammond](https://codemash.org/speaker-details?id=ee7a2db7-b2ba-45f8-b0f3-09c76620235b)

Time: Tuesday, Jan. 09, 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM

In this Pre-Compiler, we'll take a dive into the world of reverse engineering.  
  
We'll start with DotPeek and reverse engineer a handful of binaries, starting with simple and ending with somewhat more complex examples with some obfuscation. We'll also discuss problems in these tools and techniques malware authors use to avoid analysis.  
  
Afterward, we'll really get our feet wet with Ghidra. We'll look into reversing some C binaries, C++, and Go.  
  
If time allows, we'll look into more complicated examples of malware analysis and level up skills all around.  
  
Some knowledge of C# and x86 assembly is helpful but not required! Come out for a half day of reverse engineering fun!
