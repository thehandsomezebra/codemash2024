[[TRANSCRIPT Dev containers- What are they and why do you need them]]


Dev containers are also known as remote containers or developer containers. The term "Dev containers" was coined by Microsoft, while the term "remote containers" was used earlier.

Dev containers are used to create a consistent development environment that is isolated from the host machine. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as:

- **Ensuring that developers have the same development environment, regardless of their operating system or hardware configuration.** This can help to prevent bugs and other issues that can arise when developers are working on different systems.
- **Reducing the risk of security breaches by isolating the development environment from the host machine.** This is especially important if developers are working on sensitive data or code.
- **Speeding up development by providing a pre-configured environment that developers can use without having to install and configure software and dependencies.**

To use Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the "Extensions" icon in the left sidebar.
3. Search for "Dev Containers" and install the extension.
4. Once the extension is installed, you will see a new "Dev Containers" icon in the Activity Bar (`cmd` + `shift` + `p`)
5. Explore some of the options available here.

You can now use the Dev Container to develop your code. The Dev Container will be isolated from your host machine, so you can be sure that your development environment is consistent and secure.

The rest of the presentation was a live demonstration of how to use a dev container.
