**Writing documentation that users want to read is crucial for effective communication and user satisfaction.** To achieve this, focus on using verbs, understanding the user's perspective, and organizing content logically and concisely. By using verbs and active voice, you can make your documentation more engaging and easier to understand. Organizing your documentation around user tasks and goals, rather than abstract concepts, ensures that it is relevant and helpful to your users.



**Reference documentation is comprehensive, focuses on the product, and is designed for quick retrieval, while tutorial documentation is not comprehensive, focuses on the user, and is read from beginning to end.**

- Reference documentation is for experienced users who need detailed information about a product or service.
- Tutorial documentation is a step-by-step guide that helps users learn how to use a product or service.

**Reference documentation includes:**

- **Man pages:** These are short help pages that provide information about commands, system calls, and other programs.
- **API references:** These documents provide information about the functions, classes, and other objects that make up an API.
- **Code comments:** These are annotations in code that explain what the code does.
- **Readme files:** These files provide an overview of a project, including information about how to install and use it.

**Tutorial documentation includes:**

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides that teach users how to perform a specific task or series of tasks.
- **How-tos**: Similar to tutorials, but typically focused on a single, specific task.
- **Walkthroughs**: Guided tours of a product or service, often with screenshots or other visual aids.
- **Use cases**: Real-world examples of how a product or service can be used to solve a specific problem or achieve a desired outcome.


Write documentation that users actually want to read by focusing on verbs, understanding the user's perspective, and organizing content in a logical and concise manner.

- **Use verbs to convey actions and make your documentation more engaging.**
- **Organize your documentation around user tasks and goals, rather than abstract concepts.**
- **Write in a clear and concise style, using active voice and avoiding sales jargon.**
- **Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to make your documentation easy to skim and understand.**
- **Provide specific examples and instructions to help users complete their tasks.**
- **Test your documentation with users to ensure that it is clear and helpful.**
- **Use a confident casual tone and address the reader directly.**
- **Use visuals to make your documentation more engaging.**
- **Keep your documentation up-to-date and make it easy for users to find.
