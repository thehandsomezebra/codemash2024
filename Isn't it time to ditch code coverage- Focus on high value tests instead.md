[[TRANSCRIPT Isn't it time to ditch code coverage- Focus on high value tests instead]]


**During this session, the speaker covered the idea that code coverage is not a reliable measure of quality and that focusing on it can lead to a culture of quantity over quality.**

- He argues that code coverage is often used as a proxy for quality, but it does not actually measure the correctness or robustness of the code.
- He also points out that code coverage can be gamed, which means that developers can write code that satisfies the coverage requirements without actually improving the quality of the code.
- Instead of focusing on code coverage, the speaker encourages developers to focus on writing high-quality code that meets the needs of the users.


**There are three main challenges that prevent building a culture of quality in engineering teams:**

- **The belief that quality is subjective.** Some people believe that quality is in the eye of the beholder and that there is no objective way to measure it. This can lead to a lack of focus on quality and make it difficult to hold engineers accountable for their work.
- **The lack of a shared understanding of quality.** If engineers don't have a shared understanding of what quality means, they will not be able to work together to produce high-quality products. It is important to define quality clearly and consistently so that everyone is on the same page.
- **The pressure to ship quickly.** In today's fast-paced tech industry, there is often pressure to ship products quickly, even if they are not fully complete. This can lead to cutting corners and sacrificing quality. It is important to find a balance between speed and quality so that products can be released on time without sacrificing their integrity.



**Building a culture of quality in software engineering is challenging but crucial, and everyone in the team has a role to play in achieving it.**

- Changing a culture is difficult, but it is essential to foster a culture of quality where individuals hold each other accountable and focus on high-value testing.
- Objective metrics like code coverage may not effectively measure quality and may lead to unproductive efforts to meet targets.
- Influential individuals, including individual contributors, can drive cultural change by promoting values and behaviors that prioritize quality.
- Overcoming challenges such as tech debt, documentation burden, prolonged projects, and decision-making paralysis is necessary to build a high-performing team.
- Encouraging a culture of quality leads to happier engineers and a more productive work environment.

**Individual contributors play a significant role in shaping culture.** WE are the ones who are actually doing the work and interacting with each other on a daily basis, so we have a lot of influence over the norms and values that develop in the workplace. If individual contributors are committed to quality and hold each other accountable, they can create a culture of excellence.
