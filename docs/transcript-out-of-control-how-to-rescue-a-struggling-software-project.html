Yes, how's it? Comes back going? That that sounded completely disappointing. I hope it's pointed better than that sounded. All right, I'm not going to do the pet pet thing. We got, we got the special cover in here y'all. Wow, this is a crowd, this is great. So I guess everybody, you know I was at lunch and uh Somebody at the table talked about how They're one of their favorite things in software development is when they get assigned to a project that's a shit show. Wow. Okay, I could see how maybe that's. That's plus there are some benefits to it and that's sort of what we're talking about here. We're talking about rescuing. A failing project and struggling project. And this is a talk about police. Enjoy that experience here. I want to start with a little story here. So I'm an individual client comes to me and they come to me because Lips spent over three million dollars, paying a third party tonight. Some softball. Yep. And that software does not run and isn't really demoable, there aren't any features that work reliably or fully complete. There's a lot of half completed ideas. Thank you as an Accenture and I've been really to show for their millions of dollars of development. Is a terrifying place to be so you can imagine when somebody comes to me, they're saying, help me, because if I don't write the ship, then I'm losing my job because I was the person in control here. And I trusted this third party that didn't work out. And as a consultant, this little story It's really quite common. That's why somebody comes to a Consulting is because they know they're sick and they want to get something specifically fixed here. So this talk is going to focus on a few principles that I found that are really useful for rescuing struggling software projects which is effectively how I spend my time as credit developer, I'm very focused on improving the front end, but what you find is a lot of what's going to be it here on the list is not even front end specific, it's just To consider. So the problems that came up over the last year. There's two clients that I'm going to be drawing from in here. But again, I'm choosing Global things that I think will sound very familiar to you too because some of the principles that you can do to fix things, we spend millions and it's not demoable. The crash is too much to show stakeholders. Nothing is done. Everything is partially complete and we can't seem to ship a stable release. It takes us weeks to fix puzzles. This is a really awful place to be, but it happens and then it happens too because really, it's just the nature of the world that Chaos is the default. We have to fight against chaos every day and elegance in software is not natural. It is our job to try to find it every day. And in fact, every pull request, I feel that sometimes I look at a bull request when I feel like, oh, this moves us in the right direction and that'll get some full requests. So I go, this is actually moving us for chaos and that That sometimes is necessary but it's, it's often something that we need to address at that time. So, I'm going to draw from experience with two clients. One of them is a lesson truckload shipper and another one of them has a commercial electrician app. I've Learn a number of things working with them over the last many months, to help improve their projects and both of them came to be more or less. In the same situation just saying here we are. We have But what we don't have is an application that we feel like we could ship and we don't feel like we can trust or and we don't feel like our patterns are going to scale. Our developers are struggling to deliver features is taking way longer than we expect and there's lots of reasons. Why. Okay, so In the beginning, we're talking about projects with no tests, no glitching, many environments, you know, formatting. One of the clients said they were using typescript, but when I looked at their code base, there were over 1 300 NAV code. What was actually going on was every file was not TS file and then they just used any newly everywhere. It was rare to not see an end which, uh, When you see that, it's so intimidating. There can be this feeling of Well, why bother somebody open? Another pull request that has a bunch of enemies. We already have them. I just tweeted him off as yesterday. This this idea of the broken window here, and this is an old idea, but it depends on the idea that you can walk through an old neighborhood and we'll see broken windows on a buildway. And what you'll notice is, once one lender is broken, people don't fix it. People, look at that building and they, they see it as a sign of just repair and they were started throwing rocks through other windows will see people sneak inside and maybe even try to live there. It says nobody cares and it's software. Time is it's the debt that we know exists and things that we know, we shouldn't have done the stuff we'd like to fix. So it's very dangerous to have this stuff. Proliferate, it creates a momentum of sorts. He had no baseball components, complex redundant data fetching and caching no response validations no error handling and it was as a result extremely unstable. This is far from an exhaustive list can give you a sense of how tough this was. I sat down with a team. I looked at your code and it was one of these clients. After I met with the team and I looked at what they were doing and discuss their processes, I created a document that audited everything that they were doing, not just their code, but also the way they're working with the credit, the way they're working with each other, and whether behind the requirements tickets for requests code review, Pages. Around 50 different things and I was very specific about suggesting that they fix it and I stopped at around 50 because in my experience at some point it just feels like okay enough you get the idea it doesn't have to be Complete. Um, but it does show us directionally a number of things that we could do Loosely in in order and that's one thing that I suggest is If you know that things were bad at your team on your company, you, you may not necessarily have a manager or manager above you, that knows. How rough things are like you do have to convey those things, but I do encourage you to do. So in a way that moves the ball forward, that is suggestive about how to improve things rather than nearly complaining. It's really nice to bring a solution and say I suggest we do this instead. So what we're going to do is talk about what I call 15 principles for salvation, that's our goal. Here is to save these projects that are struggling. One is first because I have found. It's probably the most important one I believe that if it's worth checking, it's worth automating. And I don't expect any of you in here to disagree with me about that, that this this isn't particularly Exciting or maybe surprising, but I suspect that many of us Are doing code reviews today. And pointing out things that could be automated. Many of us are doing deployments and we're doing the same thing when it could have been automated. If we are manually typing in commands dragging files, running processes, What it should be automated. If it can be, it almost certainly should be Uh so I want to talk about just various examples of automation. One is if code isn't properly, formatted the solution is to yes we can talk about it in code review or you can just automate the formatting and that's when you use a tool like prettier, just one example. So, if you are not model, formatting your code. I'd encourage you to look for one, this removes a whole set of things that can waste time and coded into no longer arguments about this thing. Standards if we have coding standards. I'm going to let those standards and I want to lend them strictly. This is another thing that was going on, one of these Pines, actually had es1 configured. But when I ran es, what there are literally thousands, thousands of orders, And this is the boy that cried both problem and it happens all the time. I used to do a lot of work in.net before. I started focusing more on just front end and at.net. It's a very common problem where teams would just ignore compiler warnings and you would end up with teams with hundreds, with thousands of different warnings. And the problem is, once you end up with more than one, all that takes is more than one people. Stop paying attention. So notice that I say Max warnings of zero because what we're saying is, I don't want any Zero broken windows because it causes me to ignore the problem. It's a bit like saying, how many broken automated tests, should we accept? Remote, you start accepting one or two. You stop paying attention when the number goes up. It's just yeah, testing both in that as well. So it really is important that we In Force zero and I do this. On the CI server. Now, this might mean that you have to disable rent, checks in some files or in some folders, you don't have to have Perfection but Directional, you you move there by first saying, okay no more new debt. No more new breakages of this rule and turn off this rule in spots where we have to. So that's the second piece of automation. So in JavaScript the tool is, yes, Lent, but in other languages, there are similar enforcement tools You can also, if you're in typescript, I'm a big fan of typescript DS9. This tool is fantastic. It's because there's an entire set of issues that happen. When you're using typescript and probably want to use typescript in a strict manner. In my experience, the more strict VR more safety that you get the whole reason we're using it is to get that compile time safety. And but wild thing is when it comes to. Yes, like for instance, just find it. The list of escort rules that might be used before. You is a lot of work. And this is a partial list of ESO attorneys that I tend to use on projects. If you have a package in npm, chances are there's some yes, splint package that might associate with them. I'm using site, playwright, there's a lead package and I'm using Cypress. There's a light pack to a new jest lit package list goes on. Oh, that's my reminder here. It's very important, y'all. I mean, I'm up on this state. It was kind of exciting. Let's cut a picture together. We're all friends. I don't know how I'm going to fit everybody, but we're going to go to like this one blue. Okay, let's put our hands out like where where Tonight, there's a party. We have free dinner. Here we go. Fantastic. All right. Sorry people at the edges. You don't fit. I don't know how to do panoramic selfies, but that would be cool. All right. So, another example, we want to forbid a library, I use no restricted Imports. This comes in pretty darn handy. So examples of this is, instead of working in react. I don't want people importing jQuery or any given or view or these things. Shouldn't be in our projects, you can just put them in a list of forbidden nipples. Not that those in particularly likely a better example. Is this, imagine that we decided that our date library is going to be day F windows. We want to make sure that people don't pull in Mobile because that is a big heavy alternative. If not People that led away before they write a bunch of code and depend on that and open the PR and then go out of front. It I didn't know we had this other solution out here. This happens all the time. Another example of this is maybe we abstract away a library because we want to put our own opinions on it. A good example this is maybe there's a component library and we want to use it but we don't want people using it directly. We can actually forbid importing that library and then our reusable components can put exceptions above that allow us to use that. Anybody tries to use material UI directly, they will get a line from PS5 that says don't call mui directly use our text input component instead. So yes lint is a education tool, it's real time feedback superhandy Another thing is we want to catch stop moving tests. Uh, so you can use the plugin. No only test you ever had this iPhone or you put pop only on a test and then you commit it. And you don't realize that your CI server is now running one test. And if that sits for a couple weeks, might not realize people broke a lot of stuff because only one test was running. Hopefully somebody notices but this helps catch up. This will break the CI build, if it's there. We want to catch test with no circles or sorts of things there, too. Maybe accessibility is important to you. It's not highly recommend it. There's an important topic. Hacks is a great tool for this and I can automate accessibility checks. Now this is A very impartial solution on the caution trusting facts and access to be clear. It is clear but recognize that it's a bit like, installing a usability on a ux automation, check, you can check some things but we actually need to do is check XXX accessibility manually and that means fire, app has been made to use assistive tools, maybe get some users to actually try it. Make sure that your markup is actually Another one. This is one of my favorite tools. Recently is knit, knit is just four typescript and checking onions code and pipes that are probably similar tools in other spaces, but but the reason that mint is particularly relevant from typescript is keep in mind, you're not required doing these types picked everywhere. And you might, I mean, for instance, declare types that you don't actually reference, you might end up declaring, uh, Is in other code that doesn't need to be exported. This will catch those things clean things up. You might have spelling of space. I used to use spells you sell automate. Checking, for spelling spelling is important. It is it isn't a usability issue. It's just going to rehabilitate this month. I've worked in code bases. Where simple terms like the word project were misspelled across the entire application window, right? Like wire was calling project for the Y. Uh, it it was very So it would be fun. So some spell is great because again, you run that on your CI server that will fail to build. If there's a spelling issue, you can, of course, run this on your client with things like husky, if you want to, it's also useful. Does it do what we expect? And this is of course where automated testing comes up. And with my clients, these two that I've been thinking about here, one thing that we've been struggling with is I've learned this year that automated testing is even harder than I thought it was even after all these years, I've struggled with it because With at least one of these clients, what we're dealing with is we can write automated tests and those automated tests are, well, written the whole structure, but the application itself is flaking. And if you add automated tests to a flaky application, the result is flaky text. There's no way around that but at the time we didn't know it was pointed and the problems as a consultant there's helping them write test. They kept going this stupid, testing tool doesn't work. These tests flaked a lot, like the tests are signal. The tests are telling them that the application is blinking. They need to figure out why it's crashing. There seems to be a database connectivity issue over here. There also seems to be a race commissioner over here. That group paused but it is really easy to want to blame the testing tool when it's actually telling, who your house is on fire. So, It's probably not a bug in between these. These are pretty good tools at this point. Okay, how do we know if all this works? Well, which is CI and everything that I just mentioned, if you only run it on your machine, you're not getting very much. Out of that, that's what's wild to me. Is the clients that I work with. I work with one, they had written a number of automated tests but they never configured them to run on CI. So when they ran them to show me a couple of them failed and they said, oh yeah, we we haven't run them. You know, a few days looks like some things were addressed, you know. Yeah, that's not surprise me and not running automatically for every. That's what will happen. You got to automate it. And I also just think about this in terms of, uh, Overhead, like once I have Reliable tests and reliable CI, a magical thing happens. Project. I was working on a year ago, was one of the best code bases that I've worked on because I worked with a few really talented people and we got to work from scratch and all of us had this sheer Vision. We understood the technology, we all believed in automated testing, we understood how to mock out our back end, we created a front end. That was so Rock Solid and test covers. That was so good that we didn't actually run the front end. A lot of the time to make changes. We Us see the test pass and feel that confident. Like I could go ahead and run it manually and see this do it but I know if the tests are passing then this is doing what I want. Like that level of confidence is intoxicated, it is a wonderful way to work sleep, very well at night. So this is a very partial list and I just shared and I want to draw attention to a site called Dora or devops research and assessment. Site is a treasure Trove of good information about devops best practices and you could just peel off for an hour or so and click through this and look at all these things. I look at this a little bit like throughout the pop works and you look at a lot of the sort of Timeless advice that exists from men. A lot of modern Valor blogs and things like that, where I can see all sorts of things that I should probably be doing to mature our organization. So, you could very much use this as a checklist and you'll know'll Those suggestions like database change management. Loosen a couple of architecture and monitoring observability, test Automation, and so on. So I certainly don't have Uh the time in here to get into the details. So I just want to sort of draw your attention to this, losing the heart of the world because I have not been told a few weeks ago, see there's not very many hands. Somebody tweeted it at me and I went this is this wow, this is really useful. Okay, so that was principle one. Automate everything that you can now principle two is, if you can't automate it, create a checklist. And I've talked about the book, The checklist Manifesto years ago. And I really love that book because what it points out is all sorts of professions use checklists to make sure that please stay fine. Think about hires before they take a plane up, they are actually going through a checklist because some things can't be motivated. Uh, can't be, uh, Automated. And an interesting thing that they do in Japan, is they actually have a Call appointment call. I think is what it's called where they will do checks, or they will say out loud. What? They're checking, what they're pointing at. So somebody else is watching them. Look at things like this switch is off. This knob is a five, this is in neutral. Okay, now we're ready to move the train. And you'll notice there's a lot of things here that are high level and if you create a checklist, we should actually populate a pull request using, pull request template.md. If you create it, put these things in there. And you'll notice, I'm deliberately being high level because I see these as lenses where you look in code and I want to ask myself, is this code secure is this code tested business code visible and so on. Because think about how if I said is this code accessible. Well, To do that. I read the code in a very different way. And then, if I ask is this code performant, or is this code secure or is this code usable? Like usable for instance, means, I need to run the darn thing. I really can't gauge usability nearly by reading code because it's hard to run the application in my head. So, I would encourage you to think about checklists or those other things that need to happen and to try to keep that checklist short and high level. So that these are considered And a couple more things, you might consider no comment about code. I, this is one of those things that is, uh, As far as I can tell, can't be automated because comments or comments, but sometimes people comment out codes. So, that's another thing that I look for in code reviews, I generally would reject a code review with commented out code. I would say, can we use a feature toggle? Instead should this be deleted, what's the nature of the section? Can be at least put a comment above saying why does this happen? And also approved, byproduct of it. It's ideal to get these these approved earlier. Okay, principle number three, if it's decided document it, if surprising how often I would talk to teams and they didn't actually agree on what their process was conversations. Have happened, nobody documented it. People come and go employers and we don't really know what we're doing. So I really like to co-locate docs with the code. And that means consider a readme.md, consider putting something in the code itself. Reason that co-locating docs is useful, is Discovery is not a problem. Access is not a problem. The developers need to read this thing, we'll be able to find it. I'm not a fan of sending things outside because it tends to be where stuff gets lost. So, Also little things like focusing, your color comments on why instead Okay, I just talked about this a second ago, but another thing that I've learned is the importance of co-locating code, and one of the things that I look for in here is when I look at someone's code base, I look for whether their file structure gives me. A sense of what their sight would look like. What the application would look like? And if you co-locate code, that tends to happen more. Now the opposite of co-locating code is organizing files by type. So when you see an example, this might be, we have folders or controller or model, and View, and records and types and so on, that's organizing the files by type. I encourage you to organize files by featur. Trying to structure your UI code in a way that mirrors your user, your URLs. And you look at popular libraries or Frameworks like nextgs, for instance, it has Firebase traveling. That's one of the reasons. Pilebase, gravity is amazing because Bobby's routing means for me to get The routes I want, I have to put the files. That are related to one another in the same spot. I'm not technically required. I could go ahead and reference files elsewhere, but it really encourages me to put related things together. So the common places where this is broken is I'll see people create a components folder and just slap things in there. Uh, so instead trying to group those things together can really be helpful. Another thing that goes on this is related to That broken Windows theory. Okay. How many in here being honest, there is code in your current code base that you hope nobody copies do not copy those patterns. Like, look around the room. That's that's a huge portion of the room. And the rest of y'all have already fallen asleep. I trust everybody in this uh the the nature of Software is. We find better patterns as we go, we learn from our mistakes, we innovate over time, so almost every code base has pieces that we basically need to say, don't do this anymore. So one of the other things that I found helpful is to draw a real bright line around that. And one thing that you can actually do is if there is a section Of the app that is using Legacy code to put it in a folder called Legacy or Legacy underscore. Do not copy the patterns within this folder, call it something long where everybody really understands? Hey, the stuff in here is necessary But it's not our future, it doesn't represent patterns that should proliferate. So if we see people copying files in there and mimicking, those patterns, it really helps the code, reviewers helps. Everybody understand that thing because, you know, I've, I've been thinking a lot here lately about how much Leadership and software development is a lot like being a chef at a restaurant. And you think about a chef at a restaurant, I'd come in and say all right everybody we're going to create a new menu and that Chef is going to come in and specify the recipes, how long to cook things and the temperatures and people are going to understand exactly how to recreate their Vision. Something is the same way like the first few pages where we fetch data and we validate and we declare State, we access the URL, all of those decisions. The way we do it is the way other people are very likely to do it because they're going to just open another file. They might even copy and paste that file, and start changing things. There is actually nothing wrong with that, that helps us be consistent. But the risk is one of those first few patterns were hacked. What, if they aren't? So great. That's what we're helping help. Think about putting some kind of work here. Other things that you can do is you can work things as deprecated depending on your language that's helpful but I find the folder itself can really help you centralize a whole lot of Legacy patterns. Principle 6. Make one person responsible for quality. This This may be the most controversial thing that I'm saying in here, because There have been other times that I've said this. Just in fact, I just said this recently on Twitter, that quality is everybody's responsibility. And I, And I really do believe that. Qa is not responsible for quality. Your senior developer is not responsible for quality. Chronicle is not your designer is not all of us have to be a part of and this is also why there are times as a software developer where I am really pushing when somebody asks me to do something. And I go that's just not accessible or what you're asking me to do is going to hurt the performance of our application in a way that I don't think I can fix. Can we back up and talk about what the goal is rather than the solution that you're trying to impose? Because there may be other ways to do this. So I encourage you like sometimes, Have to be pushing because if you're not and you end up in a really tough spot. But in fact, One of my clients. What they're actually struggling with right now is the fact that they have a product owner asking people to do things. That they really shouldn't be doing. But the product owner has this Odd vision for how to use a web app and how to design a web app and they're acting like a ux designer. And that's unfortunate, but as a consultant, I gotta be, I got avoid being too pushy that I decided to accept those things. So, The reason I say make one person responsible for quality, what I'm referring to is quality for the code base in this case, and apple has this model Apple believes that you have to have somebody responsible because without somebody responsible and go on that's responsible. And you think about how wildly popular this phone has become. And the reason the iPhone is so popular is not because it does more than an Android phone. Android phones is way more configurable but this does Does really reliably so people like it for that. So, Related to this, this means That one person is hopefully. Intimately familiar with the big picture. And I'm actually operating this very role for one of my clients because when I came in to help rescue the project, one of the things that I started doing was being the primary code review. I'm not the only one, but basically, I review every single polar class. So I'm literally reviewing code hours every day, which isn't It's weird, but I don't know rare people, who in your likes reviewing code, I actually do. I I find reviewing code fascinating. Here's why it's fascinating. The list of ways to write software well is fairly short, but the list of ways to screw it up is never-ending right? There are so many creative ways to take a technology and absolutely be creative. Like this is a rude Goldberg machine for contact forms. I've never seen it to the, I should write a book just on on. It's regularly entertaining and that's fun. But this this idea of having a person responsible for quality is important too because that person has a picture of the application where they can say, okay, the thing that you just did over here is actually a great code but the problem is, there's a reusable component of what a good or you could have used. So you reinvented the wheel, there's a library over here that you should use or you're using this pattern. And you're actually diverging from the pattern that we're about to launch over here. You've got to have somebody with the big picture, otherwise developers get Focus on their ticket and I'm curious. Think about your team, how many people in here? Feel like they have one person that truly sees the big picture and enforces that and catches these things? And this is what's alarming. And that is a that is 10 to the room. And in this particular concept who in here thinks that this is important though. That's the majority, that's vast majority of women. It really is important. So if you don't have someone this is the other thing that you can do you want to get a raise. I I became this person, I was not the most senior, but I was the one that cared, like, I really cared and I was willing to do the hard work of really reading, pull request of asking questions of also being harmful enough to say I'm sorry. I don't understand what we're trying to do here. I'm a little unfamiliar with the syntax, maybe is there a way we could do this differently? And it's not, it's not sexy work, it's not necessarily exciting but it is really important invaluable. So if we see the value, think about that, I should just set his assignment. My goal in this talk is for you to type out a few to-do's with your team and this could be one, like, maybe I should be that person responsible for quality that person doesn't have to be the most senior, they just have to be somebody that cares the most. But if you tell your boss that you want to do this, you're really asking for a promotion, you know, because your boss should care about this. The utmost importance and it's it's worth spending time with Okay, principle. Number seven. Run code and reviews. This is another controversial take but I have found All right, let me say if you are doing code reviews and you're not running with code, I don't think you're doing much of a code review at all. I say that as a UI developer, if, if uh, If there's no UI for it, if it's a CLI, maybe I can just kind of run it in my head, I can get a sense of these things. But honestly, how am I really supposed to evaluate this code without watching it run? How am I supposed to evaluate? Its performance? How am I supposed to really get a sense of whether we caught the validation Edge cases? It's security. Like, that's very difficult to do by merely reading code. And I believe that a big reason People are not running. Coded reviews is two things. One is we are all selfish humans and That's understandable. We're selfish humans because we tend to do what our bosses want us to do. And our bosses want us to move tickets across the board more or less as fast as we can. Now they will say that there's more Nuance than that, but in the end, a huge number of shops are exactly that way. And in fact, that's one thing that I'm up against, I will try to get some of these quality controls in and that the managers will also come up and say oh you do realize guys I know we want to write test Boggy, we can't miss these deadlines. Like if you guys don't feel like you have time to write tests, just don't mind it. We got to hit that nonsense. If you keep saying that magically no test, number get written. Because people are hearing the manager saying, Important. So Auto deploy feature branches, number three up here, this is so important. I was talking about this more this morning in my top that if you can have a setup where every time you create a feature Branch, when you commit to it, it auto deploys to a short term URL and people can just go hit that URL, that makes it way, easier for all your team to check things out. This also needs your product owner, could review that I'm curious. How many people in here? Have that right now? This is luxurious, but look, look, What that is less than five percent of the room has this? And what's bananas is It is not particularly difficult. Technology and Master. Now we are in a world where AWS and Azure and Google Cloud. There's lots of hosts out there that can go ahead and spin up uh environments for us that are short-term and host this stuff. But You do need somebody to prioritize it. Now again, I'm going to ask now that you guys have heard about it. I suppose a lot of you heard about before who thinks that sounds really nice and useful. Lots of hands again. That's so I would encourage you to write down like talk to my boss. Can we get Auto deploy and feature branches, because this is huge. Here's why it tends to work. Imagine I create a branch and what's called feature one, I commit to it. It auto deploys, app to feature1.dev.liveurl.com, something like that. There is a process that runs in front every night and it deletes any one of those feature branches that's older than a week just so that they don't pile up and waste resources. So it auto cleans up I find a week. Kind of sweet spot. We're probably not going to need that range for more than that that pull request reviews. More than we were saying. So that's the idea and once you do that too you can consider also doing real time collaborative reviews. In fact you don't need that preview process but A really nice habit is Trying to get feedback early and often. And sometimes I've worked on teams, where We have this model of a parking lot and stand up so most people are probably doing stand-ups. Remember that stand up once you're all together and you're talking say parking lot. I would like to demo where I am on this feature because I would like to get feedback even though it's just half baked. I want to show you guys the API. I want to show you a little bit of the UI. Make sure these patterns were right. What do you think of this naming? Like, the more that we do that early, the quicker our quicker views go and it's sort of like paired programming without the overhead of somebody having to pair with me all day. I get a lot of signal quickly and then I go Implement some more stuff. Okay, principle number eight validate at run time. This is something that has completely changed the game for me and I didn't realize how much I needed this. Strangely enough. I spent about 10 years working in C sharp. I'm really enjoying types. And, At that same time, I was working in JavaScript really enjoying the dynamic nature of JavaScript, and I liked both and I didn't really feel like Anita types in JavaScript now, typescript came along, and it matured, and eventually I came around to using it on the front end. What I realized though is typescript, is Time check. Cases, that's not sufficient. We actually need a runtime validation so If? You need a runtime validation, use some runtime, validation tool. If you happen to be building uis, zod is the most popular way to do so. So for example, if I'm reading the URL, I'm going to use Zod to parse that URL because I want to make sure that it's a number. If I expect it to be a number, if it's a union of a few different values, I want to make sure that it's one of those acceptable values. If it's an object that's been serialized into a URL encoded value or want to parse that and make sure it versus to what I expect. If it doesn't the beauty of it is, I want it. I know that's really key. So Zon is one example of this validating at runtime. So this is useful with apis. It's useful with URLs. That might be malformed. It's useful for local storage. And it's useful for file reading. All these places where we're at the boundaries of our application if we're working in typescript for instance Having that one-time validation is key. Okay, principle number nine. This one, maybe surprise. Me the most. So my client comes to me and and this is the line where they were saying we're struggling, just getting coach production. And I said, okay, well let's talk about your flow, let's talk about your environments. And they said, okay, well we've got a deaf environment and we have a QA environment and we have the stage environment, and we have ft1 and ft2 and Mr. And I go, wait, wait, ft1 ft2, the moment. Did somebody mentions an environment that I don't understand? Flashing red lights pop up. And I'm I want to emphasize this to all of you. How many of you have an environment? That no one else probably has an environment that name? Cuz if you're raising your hand chances are that is a problem and here's here's why. So we don't understand why we need a Devon wire, it's for developers to do their work. They understand why we need a staging environment. It's so that we can integrate and make sure that everything is ready for production. Before we push the button, we might even understand why we need a QA environment, although that's not necessarily even a necessity anymore, depending on how you structure the rest of your flow. And Load the gray line where I really start worrying where you've got also a uat environment, or you might have the environment that's named after some team. This is what I was dealing with. Was they actually had environments. For teams. So imagine that you've got an application that's actually built. By two teams. And they each have their own environments. And here's what they were doing. They had their own environments and then they would deploy to production and wonder why they didn't integrate well. Because they weren't integrating until they went to production. So it's it's very obvious that I wasn't going to work well. So then they tried integrating in stage, but it was still painful because now we're finding out at the point of staging that the stuff that we did in the API isn't actually working with the UI. So in this case, it was an API team and a user interface team that were not really interacting with one another. They weren't communicating weren't collaborating. So In this case is to shift left and when people say shift left, what it really mean is Try to communicate early and often and collaborate, so that these things actually fit together. So, Fewer environments. Strangely, it helps us do just that there. I often see this where people will create environments, companies will create environments to pave over some process issue. Where they basically all my clients have the environment that basically existed because some product owner needed to sign off. So they would move it from this environment over to the separate environment, just to the Broncoer can sign off and then they move it over into this other environment. So other people could sign off and go. What Imagine you have that short-term feature branch that I was talking about? I open up feature one, I open a pull request, it deploys out to a URL. My co-workers go review the code, they run the app at that morale, my product owner, they go to that URL, when they look it over and they say, yes, it looks good. Maybe even QA goes to there, we have separate QA at that point. Aren't we done? Is there anything more to do? Here are all the tests passing, because what I'd like to be able to do is Click merge and that's your go to production in the next five minutes. And I shouldn't have to do anything more than that. And that's how you end up with teams. Like Amazon that are deploying, many times a day, because it is, Continuously deployed. But the opposite of continuous deploy is when you have these Separate environments where we go in and we batch up work and we talk about releases and release dates here. Here's the sad truth, one of my clients I've been trying to move them in the direction of continuous delivery, continuous integration but the reason fundamentally why we can't is the business does not trust me and the business shouldn't trust them because they've kept having issues in productions. What did the business do they say? We're going to create a change advisory board. We're going to Event on Fridays at noon and you have to tell us two weeks before what's going to be in that deploy, so that we can look it over and give you approvals. Now who in here thinks that that process is going to improve quality? Nobody, nobody. Very rare to find something unanimous in a room but nobody thinks and that's going to be replied. But obviously, somebody did and that somebody happens to be someone who's not a software developer, it is a non-technical manager way up in the company, who says, I got to do something, and what we're going to do is, I'm going to have a board here of presumably smart people. Why does that fail? What is a big room but somebody call out? Why doesn't that work? Conjects. Thank you, exactly. They have no context. There's a simple principle here. Remember when earlier I was talking about the importance of having one person responsible for Quality, you want to keep that person very close to the code because they have all the context in the world. The farther that we move decisions away from people with context, the worse are outcomes. This is part of why it's so important to have powerful local government and to minimize the power of federal government. Because does the federal government have a lot of context about Sandusky, how they can make big broad. Is good for everybody, but you need a good strong, local government. That knows what's important in this city in this County. So, Same sort of thing happens in software. Principle number 10. This is huge. We need to align your repositories with the goal. So, I told you about the commercial electrical net. They had this real problem with integration and I said, well, tell me about your repos. How are they structured? Well, we have a user interface, don't react, we have a back end that's built. In dot net. We have one repository, which contains the react code. We have one more possibility that contains the business logic written in C sharp. And then we have another repository that contains a data access layer. Have three repos for something that ultimately needs to be one user experience. There are no other consumers of this API. Given what I just said, who in here, likes the idea of one repository. Does that make sense? Lunch, your hands, Bunch your hands. Those are pretty easy decision to make and I want to be clear. Monorepos are not always the answer. I talked about this a little bit this morning monorepos are useful in making Polo K code that changes together put those things together. So it was really obvious to me that that was what we needed. Unified repositories need to have a single ux. And I put in that code together. Now when the front end changes we can make a corresponding back end change in vice versa like a great example of this was We've got a piece of Json that has a typo in. It, we misspelled user left out the E. We can change the back end to return the new Json. We can update the front end to expect that new Json update or it's not schemas to expect the user to be. Spelled this way have one, pull request that contains the corresponding changes across the world. Thank you. With that. Now we can make cross-cutting changes, we can make big refactorings and everything works better, because here's what was happening with the separate repositories. They could change things in one repository and push it up. And people over here would go, oh crap. I've got, I didn't actually realize that that had to be in this release. The UI is actually out of sync. We've made the change, but we haven't actually merged in the ad and still encoder view. So there is coordination that needs to happen and the separate recalls are actually fighting against you because you're basically playing like a three-legged You think about it? As we are actually joined at the angle? A repository one repository does that very thing. So trying to eliminate silos those together. So that is the direction that we've headed. Now, I still have not completely sold them on one repo, we're getting closer. The other thing in all of this like you guys could leave here with some to-do's. Pick the most important, one and try not to overwhelm like you're going to leave codematch with 42 things that you'd like to do given all the sessions you're going to. But prioritize a couple things that you think are the biggest twins, but this is absolutely fundamental. How do we structure our code? Are there people in here right now that have several repositories? That should probably be Put together. Oh, this is relevant, but Okay. Principle. Number 11. Streamline your developer experience. And the way that you do that is via tests and be a mosque. Now, it's not that you have to use blocks but I find that mocking is part of every DX that I do on the front end. Now, I do not want to have to hit relay the eyes all day. I want to validate against them using a few end-to-end tests, but I basically want to coach to an interface hit mox and have instantaneous feedback. I demoed this last year where I showed a to-do app that had Rich Dev tools that allowed me to Out what user I was. I'd click one tool, I could change the responses. I can slow those things down. And all of that was, configuring mock service worker, which is one of my favorite tools for doing front-end development. Is it mocks out HTTP calls, online machine, and I encourage you to create custom debt tools. Those dev tools can look very different from day to day. So, another thing I really love doing is helping teams, create these webtoons, what's fun about it is I have there the reason that there's no like software Company viewing, it is. It's custom the what the depth effect that you need for your app is going to look different than everybody else's but the sorts of things you're going to have in there is make it easy to change users, make it easy to toggle features. Make it easy to force, apis to return different responses, make it easy to set, delays, all sorts of things like that, that you'd like to be able to do as part of your development and as part of your tests, your other goal is not to have to manually interact with the app, you want to run a test and It interact with the app for you tools. Like, playwright and cyclists are fantastic for these sorts of things. So this is another area that I've tried to spend a lot of time on Okay. Principle 12, you've got to collaborate and do that truly. This is very related to the repository thing. I talked about Conway's law this morning which says that companies tend to create software that mimics their organizational structure. So if you have two separate managers managing debt teams, that actually need to act as one, which you can really probably need to do is try to have one manager that managers both of them or at the very least, have somebody up above whose job is to keep the two in sync. You need a structure that will encourage that organization. You've got to truly collaborate That was one of the things that wasn't happening, like one of my clients that what they're dealing with is they have people in the Middle East and South America and Arizona. And then they have me in Kansas City and we all get on the stand up in the morning. And the problem is the overlap in time zones is really tricky cuz we're getting on at, like, eight in the morning my time and it's dinner time in Egypt for instance. So, we've got this little window to collaborate, but at least we, collaborated, I'm trying. Important that we talk about what went on. This is a huge headwind because ideally teams collaborate multiple times a day but at the very least, you've got to have some overlap. If you do not have overlap, you're going to have really fundamental problems. Avoid throwing coat over the wall. It's also important to moderate errors. It's surprising to me. Let's find out here. So I'm going to assume that most of us in here are probably building web applications. I know that's not completely the case but If? One of your users experiences a JavaScript error. In their browser. How many of, you know? That's not great. That's I'm going to say 15% of the room. It's not great. The reason this is important is pretty obvious. We want to know that users are struggling and want to know that these problems occur. There are a number of two tools out there will do this. I'm a big fan of track.js Sentry is also really popular wild rocket. You want to have something. Some software is a service that will log issues and then send them to an aggregator that give you nice charts and graphs and tools for filtering out this sort of information and visualizing it getting notifications and so on. All right, we're almost done. Principal 14, you need a design system, but the diamond design systems nobody has a shared Vision. Nobody knows exactly what the standard should be. And I see this all the time where teams are Reinventing things because they don't really have Clarity about what's reusable and where uh, also related to this. It's important to understand where those beautiful components are. And I'll bounce over to this too. We've got a document, you'll use strategy and that reuse isn't just digital components but I can't believe how often people show me a folder and I go. Okay, you got a bunch of Muppets in here which are reusable, uh, well, some of them, which ones, how can I tell? Oh, you just kind of have to know. No, no, no, no, no. Keep your reusable stuff, separate, don't have a jumper drawer, put put them in a folder called shared is my my normal view. But something like that, it makes it clear. Make it easy for people to see those things. These are few ways that I found are useful to help rescue a team. I want to just briefly talk about here, one of my clients. Now, we have end-to-end tests for every page we have unit tests and stories for useful components. We went on one of these projects from 1 300 NAS. This was a quite a few months ago. We're down to 300 now, it's not perfect but that's 1 000 nes that we have moved over time and that's just incrementally following the Boy Scout rule each poll request. We try to get get So that's been a nice way to get there. We've streamlined our data fetching, set up custom hooks to do that. Instead of caching we're validating. Our responsibility is odd. And this is fantastic because like Zod keeps telling us when you make a mistake or, you know, oh wait. I thought API would return that Json and didn't and it tells me on this exact line, when I got the wrong Json, that is way easier to debug than. I don't know why the UI crash. Uh, like those sorts of error messages are really helpful. We have a CI that runs build Storybook MSW and so on all that stuff together, and we have error gambling. And so on. So in summary, these are the 15 principles. But I've got them in here just so you can see them. Put back together here. I, Run around the world helping teams write better software and love teaching people love coaching, please, feel free to reach out to me at react.jsconsulting.com. These are the slides, I'll take a picture of this, this will open up a URL to Dropbox where you get these slides and hook them over. But basically, I pretty much think of this as hopefully, a to-do list of a few things that might be action items for you to go back to your team. See, if some of these things are worth implementing. Holding for a second. Make sure people get pictures. I'll also say, I have portions out on thorough site that's pluralsight.com react, JavaScript c-sharp rears talks and so on. And you can also find me on Twitter. I tweet every day under house, core love to interact with you out there. Uh also tonight so six o'clock, the internet's back there after you finish dinner. There's a hot tub and I'm I'm going to the hot tub. I'm gonna go have some fun. I'd love to hang out with y'all. The hot tub is indoor outdoor which is epic. Like, I think it snowed today. So we go freeze, our eyelashes and things. Super fun. Where else can you do that? Pretty cool. So, was this useful y'all?
