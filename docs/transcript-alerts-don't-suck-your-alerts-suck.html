Okay, good, awesome. Um, all right, it's just about time and I am the Thanksgiving between you and drinks and dinner. So, we are going to make this group. Before I start with the actual talk. Um, I am privileged to have the chance to speak at places like devops days and user groups, and conventions in all sorts of exotic locations, like Boise, Idaho, and Burbank and New Jersey. And uh, So when I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio, So you have no idea how absolutely delighted I am to do a neighborhood talk. And I just want to take a minute and thank the conference organizers and the volunteers and the sponsors. And just to give them a round of applause for letting making this happen. You could uh,

Speaker 2   00:55
Absolutely amazing.

Speaker 1   00:57
All right. So, a few years back, I was tweaking an alert and I accidentally cut. 772 tickets. Twice. In 15 minutes. And the worst part was, I didn't know I did it until the entire help desk. The whole group came up to my cubicle to invite me down to their area to help them. Then we close the 1442 tickets individually. Yes, they did have a mask, they wouldn't let me use it. Um, So with a little bit of time and perspective and therapy and eat some alcohol, I can reflect on that formative moment and wonder what exactly went wrong. I mean there are certainly enough enough blame to go around, right? I mean like it was a tool. Was it the operator? You know, why was I allowed to do that kind of thing. But really what I think happened is that it was an immature view of what monitoring and learning are all about and What? I'm here to talk about today, thank you for joining me on this talk alerts. Don't suck your alerts sucked. My name is Leon adano. I'm a middle-aged white man. Getting a conference talk. That's all you need. No. Al I picked out that picture to give you absolute certainty. That I don't what the hell I'm talking about because also you can find me as Leon McDonald and almost social media. My GitHub of slides are there everything. So that's like all you need to know more importantly you need to know that this is what I call an oyster talk. Now, what I mean by that is I have a little bit less than an hour I cannot teach you anything. The only thing I could do in an hour is irritate you now what an oyster becomes irritated. It does one of two things, it either creates a beautiful Pearl. Or it dies. I sincerely hope I do not irritate you to death today but I do need to let you know that it is a possibility. Instead, what I hope is that you take the ideas that I give you and just take a grain of them and think about them and mull them over and layer them with your own experiences until what you have is polished and unique and valuable to you. Now, the SRE handbook, defines an alert as, and I need to read this a notification intended to be read by a human, and that is pushed to a system, such as a bug ticket queue, an email Alias or a pager now, not to blaspheme the Holy Scripture. But what the fsct am I supposed to do with that? And the problem is that the esri handbook has failed to tell me what the value of an alert is how can I feel that anything except useless and extraneous and pointless. And

Speaker 2   04:02
Ultimately

Speaker 1   04:02
That's what this talk is about is how to make alerts more valuable. And now if you don't remember anything from this talk, I put the most important two points up first. So here's the first one. Uh, inbox rules, that handle, your email alerts. Everyone has one. They're like, buck holes, they all stink. What I mean by that is that if you have an inbox rule that handles your incoming email list, you have already admitted defeat. You've already said, I don't intend to do anything with this right now. And the only time frame that matters for an alert is right now. That's it. The second thing that you need to remember, seeing my beautiful Hill, the hill I am willing to die on. It's called FYI alerts are trash. There is no such thing as an FYI. Alert, what I mean by that people when I people say oh no, no, I just need that one because it tells me if something happened but I'm not going to do anything about it, just FYI. Right? What is that? Well, if I get the first email or the first message, I don't know anything about it. But if I see five of them happen within the first 20, 20, Guess what? Sparky. I don't get paid by the crucial. I'm gonna give you one alert when the thing has happened. Five times in 15 minutes. How about I do that instead? Okay, two things, no inbox alert no inbox rules. No FYI holds. Again, the point of this talk is to that alerts need to have values and I'm going to share why and how over a few lessons about five lessons? And the first lesson is on the fundamental nature of what alerts are. The first thing you need to remember is that alerts are not the same thing as monitoring Now the second thing is that alerts are not monitoring and the third rule is for the love of God. Alerts are not the same thing as monitoring is nothing more and nothing less than the ongoing regular consistent collection of metrics and data from a set of objects or things that's monitoring. You want to monitor everything, go, right ahead. Water the crap out of your infrastructure. That's wonderful. But alerts And dashboards and reports are all a happy byproduct of doing monitoring, but they are not the same thing. So again, you will monitor everything. You do not alert on everything. So as an example of why alerts need to be actionable about once a year, your boss comes to goat Mash and comes back with a nice shiny. Pair of socks and a monitoring tool, and he brings it back to you. And when you want to wrap that sucker, the monitor will not the socks. You probably the first thing you do is you create a CPU alert, High CPU. It's what we all do. I have a secret for you. CPU alerts are bullshit, High CPU. Cpu never mattered if I have a system that is running at 98 CPU, but it's getting all the jobs done and everything in the queue is finishing. You know what, I call that correctly sized, Okay. But what it points to is not understanding what alerts are really for. Now, before I go any further, some of you are probably thinking, oh my God. Leon is going to boil everything down to CPU Ram, disk space and bandwidth. You know that old Grandpa stuff and completely ignore the lived reality that we all live in. Which is you know pods full of containers and servers for serverless micro Services and you know uh all of that in events and logs and Metric assload of metrics and all that stuff. And, you know, that's something I hear a lot. And, you know, that that's the old grand. Fancy observability that I do. And I see this happen, a lot people get hung up on that, they get hung up on the conversation about alerts because they get bogged down and you know monitoring versus observability. What it really should be monitoring and observability. So I want to clarify for just a moment. What those two terms can mean a little bit different before you go into it? I want to draw a line. On the slide, there it is. And I say this with all love and respect to the people who were wounded in the observability flame, Wars on Twitter over the last seven or eight years. I do not mean disrespect to charity Majors because I know her and she would eviscerate me on the spot if I did. I'm really just talking about in terms of alerting what we mean. So what are some of the differences? Well, on the one side monitoring we talk about the known unknowns. Okay, I know this thing could break. We also talk about any cardinality, I don't care how uniquely the event is. In fact, monitoring often focuses on the things that are very unique. They happen all the time but I still need to know that that disk filled. I know it's gonna happen, I don't know when and it's going to happen a lot especially in a big environment, okay. We also talk about mostly manual correlation when you're talking about a lot of sort of traditional systems and interconnected systems. The only way to know that the elbow bone connects to the router bone connects to the storage array bone, is that you have to know how you correlate those things together. And finally domain specific signals. What I mean is that things that make a disk array? Look, bad, there are no resemblance to the things that make a CPU or a network system. Look, bad, their domain specific. Now, on the other side, observability frequently, observability is focusing on the unknown numbers. I don't know what could go wrong and I don't know when it's going to go wrong, but else just going to go wrong. I just don't know anything about it. That's observability ability. Hard. Knowledge means incredibly unique events. The things that either individually or in combination, you know, you have all this data coming in from all these different systems and oh, wow, I've never seen that pattern before. That's a high, cardinality event. Observability is also mostly uh, considered with having correlation baked in because you are used to dealing with a massive amount of data coming in constantly. There's no way that a human can reason about it, you'll hear that term when we talk about observability a lot, More stuff than a human brain can think about what observability tends to focus on that. And finally, they talk about the golden signals, signals that indicate Badness, irrespective of, whether you're talking about a microservice or a container, or whatever it is. And for those people who aren't familiar the golden signals latency traffic, errors and saturation. So that's the difference and the reality is that everything I'm talking about here. Applies equally to both sides of that device. It's just that by its very nature, trying to give real world examples of observability become immensely complex. We all get lost here in the example and not the point of trying to make. So I'm not trying to boil down these lessons to just like the old school monitoring is just it's easier to talk about. All right. Um, let's see here. All right, more to the point High cardinality events are derived, like I said, from a large set of disparate data types. Okay, they're all coming in and there's really only one one way to get there and that's to let the computers do the work to take all that stuff and start to find patterns. Now, the marketing people will tell you that it's AI. We in this room understand that young is a bullshit marketing term for three if statements and a trench coach. Be that as it may. I just want to make sure you understand that it is a thing like whatever you call it that observability is still using machine learning or pattern recognition or whatever three of your students and trench code to find those things and do it at a scale and at a speed that a human can't do it. All right. Back on track. Um alerts have to matter. Now they have to matter to you because you're probably the one building it but also the person receiving it. Now, what do I mean? When I say an alert matters, The point of an alert is an easy algorithm. The point of learning is to get someone if and only if some want it needs to do something right now, about a problem that is happening right now. If all those things are not true, it's not an alert. All right, Leon, but I have lots of stuff that isn't like that. What is it there? All right, fine. Let's break it down. If it does not involve a human, but it is a problem that is happening right now. We're talking about automation. Have the computer, do the work, I'll talk more about that in a little bit. If it doesn't need to be dealt with right now, you're probably talking about a report. It's important information and a human needs to deal with it. Just not right now, send them an email with all the information. If It's not a problem but it is information that's important and we're talking about a dashboard, go look at it. Frequently, people confuse dashboards with monitoring or dashboards with alerting. And I'm telling you right now, you cannot hire enough eyeballs to stare at enough screens to wait for little Blinky to go red. That is kind of learning either and it's really bad monitoring to also Finally. If you're not going to do something about it, throw it away. Once again, you're not paid by The Bushel. If no one is ever going to do anything about it, get rid of it. Not just because I'm an irritable old fart, but also because the reality is that in your monitoring system. Looking for things, alerts are actually queries, and they are querying massive sets of data on a constant basis. And if you are creating alerts that are never going to get dealt with, you are actually bogging down the system doing things that don't matter and it won't have the bandwidth to be able to do things that do matter. All right, so that's if it doesn't. Again if it's not someone doing something about a real problem happening right now, that's an alert. If it's not one of those is one of those. All right, back to CPU alerts. So there are four common pitfalls that comes to making alerts matter. And uh, the first one is the trigger condition. So going back to the CPU alert. I said that it's running at 98 and everything else is getting done then you know, correctly sized. Yay. But what if I have a CPU if I have a high CPU you know 98 and also the number of jobs in the processor view is more than the processors I have. I don't care if it's cloud-based or physical or whatever I have more jobs and An abandoned rate from my users. And I'm also seeing that connections are getting dropped and okay. That is an alert. What I just described is something incredibly different than the security us, huh? And also, even as I just sketched out that scenario, you're probably already thinking about, oh well then I would demotion it. I would expand it. I would laugh. I would do these other things, it is actionable. And you can respond to it. So that's part of making an alert valuable is what are you going to do about it? If you don't know, maybe not such a valuable alert. If you already know what you're going to do about it fabulous and we'll talk more about that a little bit too. Okay, sometimes it's not the trigger, it's the time frame. Now, you look at this uh graph. By the way, this graph came from Leon Fair if you have a chance to see either of the Leons Leon fairs, the superior Leon, you just want to let you know. But anyway, everyone looked at it and they say, they know exactly where the problem is. They know there. I that's where they learn is, except that it's not that was month. End processing from the accounting department. Fine. Or it was because it was running so low in elastic compute that it's actually dropped a few systems. And so everything seemed to spike up because I had fewer systems actually possible whatever, whatever we miss is is that That is the same rise. But our human brains don't notice that cuz it's over a longer period of time. This is the value of monitoring and alerting, our computers can watch for this and let us know, but it means that we have to have alerts that take time frame into account far too many times. I see people whose entire alert strategy is, is it bad right now? Oh, throw up the alerts, make the red light, make the sound all that stuff. Is it good now? Okay it's better close the ticket. Right. No. Has it been better for enough time? Has it been bad for enough time? Otherwise you end up with what's called Sawtoothing and you don't want that eyebrake, it's people out of bed and then angry at you. All right, the third Pitfall and it's similar is using fixed thresholds. So fixed threshold is, we're getting to say 80 or 90 and it doesn't matter what these things are. It could be disk space or bandwidth or number of users on the system or number of sales or whatever it is. If that's my threshold, a lot of these systems over time are never gonna hit that threshold better is if you use a percentage over a baseline, That means is that I use my monitoring system to collect all the data, right? And now I know what normal is, I know what normal is over time. I know what normal is for a Tuesday, I know what normal is for a Thursday in March, during month and closing, because it's tax season, or whatever it is, I know what normal looks like and then I set my threshold to say, if it's 10 above normal. That you're using your monitoring system, effectively to know what bad is for this particular thing. Relative to the way it normally operates. Best of all however is to use thresholds relative to a baseline along with a fixed threshold. So you're not doing stupid alerts because honest to God. This thing should never alert ever. Like, it's fine. It's in fact underutilized and that's a whole other conversation, but it's not my conversation. I'm the monitoring engineer. I don't care. Do whatever you're gonna do, okay? But some of these things are never going to hit the bottom threshold. Some of these are constantly living above the bottom threshold and therefore, you need to know about that. So that's the best way to do that. So again, you've got triggers, you've got time frame, and you have your thresholds. The third, the the fourth trap is a lack of automation. So again, I know this is simplistic. I understand that all of our systems are far more complex. I'm using this because it's easy to explain, not because I think that this is like a normal thing. Okay, disk is full, what do you do? You clear the temp directly? That's what everyone does. And if it fixes the problem and it goes away, you go back to bed because you don't care. Right? It it's dope, fabulous. Why are you getting out of bed in the first place to clear? The the temp directory, if that is the thing that you do, Then how automation do it there is actually nothing so powerful or so magical as being able to respond to an event. At the moment. At the moment that that problem is occurring and our moderate systems are witness to those things right then and there. And if there is an easy, obvious response have automation do it. And just as an example, that disk, space alert, I implemented, um, at Cardinal Health, and it caught 8, 000 tickets. Per month out of the queue. And it was a general savings about ten thousand dollars per month in staff time. Just by doing that. Now, not every single this full alert was resolved. That way, sometimes it was a bad disk. Sometimes it was another problem but the percentage of the ones that needed to actually be dealt with, was much lower than the ones that were being cut. And again, disk, space simplistic, but your situations more complicated. You understand them, same idea. Okay, having Automation in there to do things. So What does that look like? Oh yeah. Uh and sorry. So one of the problems that people run into is knowing what to do, like what is it that you do? And the thing is, you ask the person getting the alert, the ticket, the email, the whatever. Well what do you do? Oh well, when I see this thing happen, I take like a wrinkle command and I hear it like clears it right up Hayes. How about I type like a Frank will come in for you cuz Frankel is not a command. Don't look that up. I gave this talk in another country once and they were all like oh my God. Like no. It's Asking the person who's receiving the alert, what they do is sometimes an amazing way to find out what the next automated action is. So to give you an example, again, slightly simplist a little bit more complex but not Still not real world. All right, so the app is running on IIs timeline, the application that's running on is slow. What do you do? The thing that everyone does? When something going on IIs is slow? You clear the application pool. I do not need to wake. Anyone up to do that. I can actually run a command on the machine on the system to clear the application pool and then you wait. And if in a minute to two minutes, five minutes, whatever it is, the problem persists. Then you do what everyone does you reset the IIs service, really? That's what you do every single time and then wait. And if the problem persists, it hasn't cleared up yet. You rebuild it from an image or UV motion it or you, you know, restart the host or whatever kind of you know virtualization system you have and then you wait. And if the problem persists then you move to a new region or you you know what again whatever you're gonna do. These are all things that are easily automated. Easily automated and if after waiting the problem persists now you wake up a human being but once you wake them up with is all the feedback all the information from each of those commands. So you have effectively catapulted them forward in time. Waking up at two o'clock in the morning knowing that they have already excluded the application to reset the IIs server, blah, blah, blah blah. We've already done that. Here are the responses and you know what still broke. Go use your big human brain and figure it out and you know what people appreciate that. Back in the day. The Microsoft, the, the, uh, Exchange team was getting about 80 tickets a week and 80 tickets a week for an exchange. You know, team is a lot. They were grumpy people. And after looking at it and putting in some Automation and finding we cut it down to eight tickets a week and two things happen. First of all, they were tabier people. That was a third thing but beside that was that they responded significantly faster to every ticket they got because it wasn't you know 72 bullshit tickets and eight that were reeling. You didn't know which was which But second of all, The problems were, you know, reduced they had more time to work on other things. So automation. And that takes me the most important lesson of all. It's one you've probably heard from a lot of the other sessions talking to people nicely because no one is a psychopathic homicidal clown. Probably in your office. Not saying anything about muck. Um, But with the same determination as the world's greatest detective, who is trying to hunt down the killer of Maya. One, two three. That you want to be able to talk to people and find out. What is going on? You need to find the people who care as much about the application and their performance and talk to them to get context. Now, that takes you to the hunt for the great useful alert. And the person who cares about it, I say hunt, because the person who initially talks to you is not the one who cares about it, they're usually the application requester. They're using a project manager or something. And I'm here to tell you, they will lie to you. You are nothing but a checkbox roadblock on their path to push to production. They will say, oh yes, it's made of Iron and Steel and unicorn farts and rainbows spit. It's gonna stay up forever if nothing's gonna happen to it. No, that is another person you need to find the person who's actually going to be receiving the tickets a month from now, two months from now. They're gonna know how the application behaves. What they're worried about the things that keep them up and I didn't wake them up at night. Those are the people. And once you find that person, there's some questions, you can ask them to help build both monitoring and alerts. That matter the first question, how do you know when something is wrong? I jump on it and I type like a Frankl Commanders. Michael Frankel, come here now, Franco command and it tells me blah blah blah you know like oh how about I just run the defrinkle command every five minutes, 15 minutes whatever and Okay, that's the first. How do you know wrong? How do you know when it's all better? This is a question. A lot of people never ask. Once again, a lot of people live in a world where bass down and good is up fun, but there's a lot of cases where bad is here and good is not until it gets back up to there. You know, again simplistic example, disc alerts. If you're telling me that 90 full is bad, please do not tell me that 98. That 89 is better. All good again. No, 89 is going to go bad in another two seconds. I just know it, I'm not calling it. Good until we get back down to 75 and stay there for more than 20 minutes. Now, again, that's a simplistic example. You have more complicated examples, but the point is, is that if bad has a fixed threshold or some sort of trigger better, may not be not that. Better maybe something, lower higher, however you want to measure it and for a persistent amount of time, then you're going to call it a veteran. Oh, by the way there's no such thing as automatically closing a ticket never ever. Ever agree to implement Auto. Close reversals. Absolutely, The difference is that when you open a ticket if your ticket, if your monitoring system, your ticket system are connected. You want your modern system to open tickets and if it hits the all better? Mark, you want to then? Mark a reversal in the ticket. Not a close. The only thing that can close a ticket is a human. Because that's when a human has gone to review and sick. Yeah. Okay fine. As opposed to, oh my God, this is really bad. I need to order more parts or I need to get more clout or I need to whatever it is right? That's closing. It's a much less critical operation, it doesn't need to happen at two o'clock in the morning. It can happen at 8 A.M. That's an important thing. Another question, is there an acknowledge article for this problem yet? I refuse to roll an alert into production, unless there was an Associated knowledge article. Now if you want to give me knowledge article says, call Bob, he knows Okay. I love Bob. Preferably it's going to say do this and this and this and this if you don't know what to do about it. Why are you rolling a word out? Like what is anyone again? What's the overnight operator? What's the, you know? The other two supposed to do about this, there needs to be a knowledge article. If you can't write the knowledge article, you don't know enough about the problem yet to roll the alert into production. Can you make it happen on purpose? I want to see it. The reason I want to see it is that I was asked to make an alert every time. This log file had the word error in, it sounds reasonable except that the developer wrote messages every second. No errors to report. Remember the 772 tickets twice in 15 minutes, that was it. Okay, so can you make this happen on purpose? I want to say because spelling errors happen. Oh, that wasn't the number. Oh, it gives it to me in Celsius, not Fahrenheit. Make it happen, there's exactly one example where you don't want to make it happen on purpose. That's the alert to tell you that the data center is on fire. However, okay so joking aside, sometimes the things that you can't make trigger the trick is make it the opposite. Set your threshold, the opposite of what bad is. Watch it happen. Make that happen verify that you're getting the right data that you're getting the right metrics and all that stuff. And then you just set the reversal and then you set it in line. Okay. So, let's sum up. I have identified an interrogant. I mean interviewed. The recipient of the alerts. Well, here we go. Uh, I have designated alerts that matter because it has real word real world. I can talk trigger elements. It takes duration, Baseline into account. It includes automation and I've verified that the alert is built with the intent of immediate action by a human. The last lesson is the shortest one to explain and it's going to take the longest, it's the hardest one to do and that is that the work is never over. That once you create an alert you need to have some means of going back to the people who get them and asking them on a regular basis every quarter, every six months, every year. How is this working for you? Because maybe it never worked the way that it was envisioned because the actual load on the system was different than what the developers expected or maybe it worked initially, but things changed or the system moved or something else. You need to go back also because if you've done your job, right? Probably say no this is fantastic. But you know what? I have this other thing. Now, far from feeling like you are a victim of your own success, that means that monitoring and learning don't suck and they are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing because ultimately the job of an alert is to remove interruptions and toil from our daily lives and to make things work better. So at this point, you might be feeling irritated. I warned you, that could happen. If so, I'm here for questions. Otherwise, thank you so much for your time. I am ready for any questions that you have.
