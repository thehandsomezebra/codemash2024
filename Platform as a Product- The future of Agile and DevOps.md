[[TRANSCRIPT Platform as a Product- The future of Agile and DevOps]]

![[Platform as a Product.pdf]]



**Platforms as a product allow organizations to increase efficiency and reduce costs by consolidating resources and creating self-service tools.**


**Context switching and cognitive load are major impediments to productivity.**

Context switching is the act of changing from one task to another. It can be a major impediment to productivity in DevOps because it takes time and effort to refocus our attention and remember the details of the new task. When we context switch frequently, we make more mistakes and take longer to complete tasks.

DevOps teams often need to context switch frequently between different tasks, such as writing code, testing code, deploying code, and monitoring systems. This can be very taxing on our cognitive abilities and lead to burnout.

To reduce context switching, DevOps teams should try to group similar tasks together and minimize the number of times they switch between different tasks. They can also use tools and techniques to help them stay organized and focused, such as task lists, project management software, and mind maps.



**Platform teams can help to reduce context switching and cognitive load by providing self-service tools and resources.**

**Automation around self-service tools and resources can help to improve the efficiency and productivity of DevOps teams.** By automating tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, teams can free up their time to focus on more strategic initiatives. Additionally, automation can help to reduce the risk of human error.

Some of the benefits of automating self-service tools and resources include:

- **Improved efficiency:** Automation can help to reduce the amount of time that teams spend on repetitive tasks, such as provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and managing configurations.
- **Increased productivity:** By freeing up time to focus on more strategic initiatives, automation can help teams to be more productive.
- **Reduced risk of human error:** Automation can help to reduce the risk of human error by automating tasks that are prone to error.
- **Improved compliance:** Automation can help teams to comply with regulations and standards by automating tasks that are required by these regulations and standards.

Here are some specific examples of how automation can be used to improve self-service tools and resources for DevOps teams:

- **Provisioning infrastructure:** Automation can be used to provision infrastructure, such as servers, networks, and storage, in a repeatable and consistent manner. This can help to ensure that infrastructure is provisioned in a secure and compliant manner.
- **Deploying applications:** Automation can be used to deploy applications to infrastructure. This can help to reduce the time and effort required to deploy applications, and it can also help to ensure that applications are deployed in a consistent manner.
- **Managing configurations:** Automation can be used to manage configurations of applications and infrastructure. This can help to ensure that configurations are consistent across environments and that changes to configurations are tracked and managed.

It is important to note that automation is not a silver bullet. It is important to carefully consider the specific needs of your organization and to implement automation in a way that is consistent with your existing processes and procedures.



**Platform teams can also help to improve security, compliance, and governance.**


**Platform teams are cross-functional teams that own and manage the shared infrastructure, tools, and services that are used by multiple teams within an organization.** They are responsible for ensuring that these shared resources are reliable, secure, and scalable, and that they meet the needs of the teams that use them.

**Some of the benefits of platform teams include:**

- Reduced duplication of effort: By centralizing the management of shared infrastructure, tools, and services, platform teams can help to reduce the duplication of effort across teams.
- Improved efficiency: Platform teams can help to improve efficiency by providing a single point of contact for teams that need to access shared resources.
- Increased agility: Platform teams can help to increase agility by enabling teams to quickly and easily provision new resources as needed.
- Improved security: Platform teams can help to improve security by implementing security best practices and by monitoring the use of shared resources.
- Improved compliance: Platform teams can help to improve compliance by ensuring that shared resources are compliant with relevant regulations and standards.
- Enhanced governance: Platform teams can help to enhance governance by providing a central repository of information about shared resources and by tracking changes to these resources.



**Platform teams can be difficult to implement, but the benefits can be significant.**

**Platform teams are often seen as a way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of stream teams.** By centralizing the management of shared infrastructure, tools, and services, platform teams can help to reduce the duplication of effort and improve collaboration between teams.

**Some of the benefits of platform teams include:**

- Reduced duplication of effort: By centralizing the management of shared infrastructure, tools, and services, platform teams can help to reduce the duplication of effort across teams.
- Improved efficiency: Platform teams can help to improve efficiency by providing a single point of contact for teams that need to access shared resources.

- Improved compliance: Platform teams can help to improve compliance by ensuring that shared resources are compliant with relevant regulations and standards.
- Enhanced governance: Platform teams can help to enhance governance by providing a central repository of information about shared resources and by tracking changes to these resources.

**The decision of whether or not to create a platform team is ultimately a decision that should be made based on the specific needs of the organization.** However, for organizations that are looking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their development teams, platform teams can be a valuable asset.
